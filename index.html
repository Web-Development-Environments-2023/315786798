                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>David Scott Mustaine (born September 13, 1961) is an American musician.<br>
                        He is the co-founder, frontman and primary songwriter of the thrash metal band Megadeth<br>
                        Prior to forming Megadeth, Mustaine was the original lead guitarist of Metallica but did not appear on any albums.<br>
                        Mustaine has been to rehab throughout his life, fighting alcohol and drug problems, and briefly battled throat cancer in 2019.<br>
                        Mustaine has been married to Pamela Anne Casselberry since 1991, with whom he has two children, Electra and Justis Mustaine.</p>
                        <p>Mustaine had three older sisters, Michelle, Suzanne, and Debbie, who were 18, 15, and 3 respectively when he was born.<br>
                            Due to the significant age difference between Mustaine and his sisters, as a child he often thought of them as his aunts rather than sisters.<br>
                            Panic was Mustaine's first band. The lineup was Mike Leftwych on drums, Bob Evans on bass, Tom Quecke on rhythm guitar, Pat Voeks as the vocalist, with Mustaine as the lead guitarist. Both Mike Leftwych and a sound man were killed in a car crash after Panic's second show.</p>
                            
                            <p>Following unsuccessful vocalist auditions, he took on vocal duties himself at Megadeth's first rehearsal in addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar.<br>
                                In 1984, Megadeth produced a three-song demo with drummer Lee Rausch, who replaced Carruthers after Mustaine and Ellefson decided they could not trust him. Carruthers had chosen to hide his black heritage from them by claiming he was Spanish, and they could not understand why he would deceive them. Kerry King joined the band for a few shows; however, he opted to leave Megadeth after less than a week so he could continue working on his own band, Slayer. Jazz-influenced drummer Gar Samuelson replaced Rausch, who left after Mustaine convinced him to play with a broken foot. Megadeth recorded a demo as a three-piece band, which captured the attention of guitarist Chris Poland, also a jazz player and a friend of Samuelson, who subsequently joined the band. In November, the band signed a deal with Combat Records and began touring.</p>

                <p>Difference #1 - Interaction:<br>
                    In Web 1.0 , websites were read only.<br>
                    In Web 2.0, writing was allowed too.<br>
                    Use case : Client wants to contribute and comment on a blog post.</p>
                    
                    <p>Difference #2 - Search engines:<br>
                    In Web 1.0 , fast search, macro content, inaccurate results.<br>
                    In Web 2.0, higher accuracy by the usage of tagging, but manual and covers little percentage of the web.<br>
                    In Web 3.0, tagging is automatic.<br>
                    Use case : Client wants search for his local news website, he is more likely to find it, if it exists, in Web 3.0 than in Web 1.0.</p>
                    
                    <p>Difference #3 - Dynamic websites:<br>
                    In Web 1.0 , static webpages.<br>
                    In Web 3.0, dynamic webpages<br>
                    Use case : Client wants a cool transition effect when sliding down his website, would not be possible in Web 1.0.</p>
